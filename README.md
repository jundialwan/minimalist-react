### Babel
Babel is a transpiler. Used to "translate" ES2015++ code to ES5 code so that most of all browser with ES5 support could run it.

### Webpack
Webpack is a static module bundler. Used to bundling all your JS file to a single JS file that will be loaded by index.html. Webpack recursively builds a dependency graph of your file/module then package all of those file into one file.
